# FlowFeed

## Interactive research feed: the latest news, code, and answers all at your fingertips.

### v1.0 

FlowFeed has been designed specifically for programmers to quickly and easily get information from three searchable content resources useful to our field: **Twitter**, **StackOverflow**, and **Github**.

 * Search the latest news, repositories, and questions/answers from Twitter, GitHub, and StackOverflow, respectively.
 * Focus on and enlarge one of the three for a more fluid reading experience.

### v2.0 and Beyond...

As the project develops, we will add more APIs, both for programmers as well as professionals from connected fields, such as design, UX, and content marketing. These will be optional, additional feeds the user will be able to add, remove, and move around.

In the mature version, the user will be able to add RSS feeds, as well as any site they wish (for sites without usable APIs, we can use the Google API to render a `site:example.com` search -- albeit with a limited user experience, especially due to styling).

Therefore, in v2.0 and beyond, FlowFeed will become not just interactive, but completely customizable as well.
