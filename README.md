# FlowFeed

## A customizable news and research feed.

### v1.0 Desired Functionalities:

Initially, FlowFeed will be specifically for programmers to quickly and easily get information from three searchable content resources: **Medium**, **StackOverflow**, and **Github**.

 * Search latest articles, questions/answers, and repositories from Medium, StackOverflow, and GitHub, respectively.
 * Focus on and enlarge one of the three for a more fluid reading experience.

### v2.0 and Beyond...

As the project develops, we will add more APIs, both for programmers as well as professionals from connected fields, such as design, UX, and content marketing. These will be additional/optional feeds the user will be able to add, remove, and move around.

In a later version, the user will be able to add RSS feeds, as well as any site they wish (for sites without usable APIs, we can use the Google API to render a `site:example.com` search).
